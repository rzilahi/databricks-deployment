# VNET-Injected workspace with Secure Cluster Connectivity, also known as no public IP (NPIP) feature.

If network customization is required, you can deploy Azure Databricks to your own VNET (VNET-injection).

When Secure Cluster Connectivity is enabled customer virtual networks have no open ports and compute resources in the classic compute plane have no public IP addresses.

You can enable secure cluster connectivity on a new workspace or add it to an existing workspace that already uses VNet injection.
